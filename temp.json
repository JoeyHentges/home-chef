Not only because they are equally as fun to serve to a hungry crowd as they are to eat, but also because I've recently discovered I can cook ribs in my Instant Pot or my oven and finish either on the grill. From my annual rib endeavors I've learned which key steps for making barbecued ribs can be translated from the smoker to almost every other cooking technique. Here are five key steps for better ribs.",

  "abstract": "Tips For Making The Best Oven-Baked Ribs Season the ribs a day ahead for a deeper flavor. Add liquid smoke into the mustard for a mild smoke flavor. Lift the ribs above the baking sheet on a rack for the heat to circulate on all sides. Broil the ribs until evenly browned. Make sure the meaty side of the ribs is facing up. Brush with barbecue sauce in the last half hour of cooking. Let the ribs rest for 10 minutes. When done, your knife will easily slide into the meat."
